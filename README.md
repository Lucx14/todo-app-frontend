# Todo List app

A simple todo app built using Rails 6 as a backend Api together with a frontend app using react/redux

The backend uses postgres as database with 3 models, a todo a list item and a user. Tested with Rspec and deployed to heroku. The front end connects with axios and uses redux for state management.
